The aim of the project is to develop a web application for spell and grammar
checking. The application allows users to input text or upload a file, and it
performs spell checking and grammar checking on the provided text or file. The
user interface provides feedback on potential spelling mistakes and grammar
errors, along with suggestions for corrections.
